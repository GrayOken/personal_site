# personal_site

A Personal Site created for our career sim work

The landing page should be index. Portfolio is a short citique of capitalism through the lens of the film industry and a summary and embed of Tarkovsky's Stalker. It should be noted that basically this entire page is scuffed as soon as it isnt full screen. This will be addressed later if needed. About is almost entirely Lorem. All pages have a header and footer made with semantic html. The navigation is responsive, sticky, and styled to show the active page. App.js contains a single hello world function hooked up to a large circular button in the footer begging to be touched. Styles are, admittedly to an outside perspective, probably a fucking mess. But they follow an order that makes perfect sense to my actual broken obsessive compulsive brain. I plan on standardizing this to best practice later.
