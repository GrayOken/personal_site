							"I used to say this all the time, when people...
							back when Russia was the Union of Soviet Socialist
							Republics... and they'd say 'oh aren't you so glad
							that you're in America?' and I'd say 'Well I know a
							lot of Russian filmmakers. They have a lot more
							freedom than I have." -George Lucas
						</p>
						<p>
							Whenever I think of this film, I inexorably think of
							this quote from George Lucas. Lucas wasn't speaking
							about personal freedom, or political freedom, or
							even freedom of speech. Lucas was strictly referring
							to the constraints of capital. For the average
							American, it's nearly impossible to disconnect the
							propagandized vision of Soviet social standards from
							reality, but no film greater exemplifies the true
							artistic freedom soviet filmmakers enjoyed than
							Tarkovsky's Stalker. It doesn't take a Tankie to see
							that art and science flourished under soviet rule.
							And it doesn't take a neoliberal to see at which the
							incredible cost of life this was purchased at under
							Stalinism. But it does take an informed and nuanced
							approach to understand the complex structures that
							controlled both American and Soviet art.
						</p>
						<p>
							Mark Fisher's Capitalist Realism partly poses the
							plot of Children of Men as allegory for the
							philosophical anxiety that comes from the lack of
							"new". To quote: "Children of Men connects with the
							suspicion that the end has already come, the thought
							that it could well be the case that the future
							harbor only reinteration and re-permutation. Could
							it be that there are no breaks, no `shocks of the
							new` to come?" Fisher lived long enough to see the
							homogenization of Hollywood in a near preminatory
							fashion(Albiet the idea of capital casting out novel
							in favor of recognition was not pioneered by him).
							The interview in which I quoted Lucas took place in
							2015, and even then the average American moviegoer
							was already torn on the fatigue coming from the
							constant stream of recycled IP's. "Everything is a
							remake, a reboot, or a sequel these days". A common
							sentiment that transcends income, education,
							philosophy, and politics. In Hollywood, original
							scripts are seen as risky. Studios want to mitigate
							as much risk as possible, because they are beholden
							to investors or a board of directors. Those powers
							are investing money in hopes that it turns into more
							money. The control that comes from capital
							investment trickles back down that chain and removes
							the risk. New ideas are forced into familiar shapes.
							The Cloverfield universe films were rewritten so
							poorly to fit into their Cloverfield shaped box, it
							gives a wonderful look behind the scenes at what
							happens to "the new" today. Stalker could only ever
							exist in Soviet Russia. Everything that went into
							the film; the material conditions to the
							sociopolitical environment. The window in which a
							film would even approach this is rapidly closing,
							and might have already closed.
						</p>

							Loosly based on the novel Roadside Picnic by authors
							Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, Stalker is about a man
							whom works in an unnamed location as a "Stalker"
							leading people through the "Zone", an area in which
							the normal laws of physics do not apply and remnants
							of seemingly extraterrestrial activity lie
							undisturbed among its ruins. The Zone contains a
							place called the "Room", said to grant the wishes of
							anyone who steps inside. The area containing the
							Zone is shrouded in secrecy, sealed off by the
							government and surrounded by ominous hazards. The
							Stalker guides 2 men through the military checkpoint
							guarding the entrance, then the open and dangerous
							wilderness of the Zone, to the Room. Along the way,
							they discuss motivation, ambition, fears, and life.
							Like a fractal, a seemly simple plot and theming,
							that upon closer inspection is infinitely complex,
							so much so that deep analysis is somewhat futile,
							yet as a critic we are drawn to do. Filmed on a
							paltry budget of $52,000 adjusted for ('23)
							inflation,
